Nepal Earthquake Tweet AnalysisÂ¶
On April 25th 2015, just before noon, Nepal experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale. The earthquake ripped through Kathmandu valley, and a series of aftershocks leveled entire villages.
Immediately after the earthquake, volunteers from around the world were instrumental in guiding emergency operations, using satellite imagery to identify infrastructure destruction throughout the region.
People on the ground in Nepal were also generating tremendous amounts of information which could be of use to rescue operations, albeit less directly: on twitter. Between April 25th and May 28th, 33,610 tweets were tweeted by people in Nepal. These tweets were full of useful information, but 33,610 tweets is simply too many for a rescue operation to comb through.
However, messages posted on microblogging sites often contain rumors and overstated facts. In such situations, identification of factual or fact-checkable tweets, i.e., tweets that report some relevant and verifiable fact (other than sympathy or prayer) is extremely important for effective coordination of post-disaster relief operations. Additionally, cross verification of such critical information is a practical necessity and resource availability. Hence, automated Machine Learning techniques are needed to identify the tweets that talk about the need of resources or availability of resources.
